## Overview

This repository contains a collection of microservices codebases, designed to facilitate the development, deployment, and management of distributed systems. Microservices architecture promotes modularity and scalability, allowing each service to operate independently while contributing to the overall functionality of the application.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to understand how to build a end-2-end system with the tools that are available online/open source. For example if someone is trying to build a e-commerce system, what and all things they need to build interms of design,code etc.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the microservices, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Programming Language**: Make sure you have the required programming language(s) and their respective runtimes installed.

- **Docker**: To containerize microservices for deployment and testing.

- **Kubernetes** (optional): If you plan to deploy microservices using Kubernetes.

## Folder Structure

- Each microservice is organized into its own directory within the `services` folder.
- Common utility functions, configurations, and shared libraries can be found in the `common` directory.
- Deployment configurations (e.g., Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests) are located in the `deploy` directory.
- Documentation and README files for individual microservices can be found within their respective directories.

## Dependencies

- List the dependencies required for building and running the microservices.
- Include any specific versions or installation instructions.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run, test, and interact with the microservices. Include any environment variables that need to be configured, as well as example commands for local development.

```bash
# Example usage for a microservice
cd services/microservice-name
npm install
npm start
